**Machine Learning for Brain Tumor Classification Using ResNet18

This project presents a deep learning approach for automated brain tumor classification using MRI scans, implemented with a custom ResNet18 architecture in PyTorch. The model is designed to assist medical professionals by providing accurate and efficient tumor categorization, potentially improving diagnostic workflows in clinical settings.

The implementation begins with a carefully curated dataset of brain MRI images, preprocessed through resizing, normalization, and proper data splitting to ensure robust model training. The custom ResNet18 architecture incorporates residual learning blocks with skip connections, batch normalization, and adaptive pooling, enabling the network to learn complex features from medical images effectively. Training utilizes the Adam optimizer with cross-entropy loss, while performance is evaluated through standard metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall, along with visual interpretability techniques such as Grad-CAM.

Beyond its immediate classification capabilities, the model is designed for practical deployment, with features like GPU acceleration, model checkpointing, and standalone prediction functions. Future enhancements could include integration with 3D convolutional networks for volumetric analysis, advanced data augmentation techniques, and federated learning approaches for multi-institutional collaboration while maintaining patient privacy.

This implementation demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to critical healthcare challenges, offering a balance between technical sophistication and clinical applicability. The modular design allows for continuous improvement through transfer learning and architecture refinements, while the comprehensive evaluation framework ensures reliability in real-world medical scenarios. As the model evolves, it has the potential to become a valuable decision-support tool in neuroradiology, contributing to faster and more consistent brain tumor diagnoses.**
